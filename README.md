# Identification-of-the-optimal-ingredient-mix-for-Pancakes
To measure the perceived quality of pancakes given controlled variations in the ingredients used. Over the past few months all of us tended to cook food on our own and whenever we made pancakes we noticed that all the pancakes looked different each and every time we made them. Upon delving into this occurrence, we noticed that for minor variations in our ingredients we ended up getting such highly perceivable differences in our end products. That's when we realised that ideally, an optimal mix of the ingredients for pancakes should exist such that for a given sample size the bulk of them would prefer them.
